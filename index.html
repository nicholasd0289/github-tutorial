<ul>
<li>What is <em>Git</em> and how is it used?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Git:</strong> is used as a a tool for <em>version control</em>, like a snapshot, and works through the command line. Git <strong><em>does not need</em></strong> GitHub to work.</p>

<ul>
<li>What is <em>GitHub</em>?<br>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>GitHub:</strong> is used to <em>collaborate</em> with others, as well as visually track any changes made to your code and it's all stored on the cloud. GitHub also <strong><em>requires</em></strong> the use of git to work.</p>

<h2>
<a id="initial-setup" class="anchor" href="#initial-setup" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Initial Setup</h2>

<ul>
<li>First, create a <a href="https://github.com">GitHub account</a> for use with Git.<br>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Linking your <a href="https://c9.io">Cloud9 account</a> (can be signed in with GitHub) with your GitHub account requires the use of a <strong><em>Secure Shell</em></strong>, or <strong><em>SHH</em></strong> key, so information does not have to be included on a regular basis, and is always remembered.</p>

<ol>
<li>Your SSH key can be found within the <strong>settings</strong> tab of Cloud9, <em>once signed in</em> (Top Right, gear icon), and is in the menu to the left once inside titled "SSH Keys".</li>
<li>Once you've copyed the SSH key, return to your GitHub account and navigate to settings, <strong>located once you've clicked your profile icon</strong>. Once inside of settings, to the <em>left in the sidebar</em>, should be a tab titled "SSH keys".</li>
<li>Once inside this tab, there will be a button titled <em>"Add SSH key"</em>. Once clicked on, paste your SSH key into the box titled "key", and the title of the key should be Cloud9, or c9.io.</li>
<li>Next, time to set up your global username/email, for use in your IDE, which can be done with two commands, one being, git config --global user.name (Your first and last name goes here, without parenthesis), and git config --global user.email (Your email here)</li>
<li>After this step has been completed, in the console on the Cloud9 IDE and type "ssh -T <a href="mailto:git@github.com">git@github.com</a>" (without quotes), and it will prompt you to say yes or no, type yes.

<ul>
<li>When this step is finished, you should get a message in your console saying, "Hi ! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access."</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<a id="repository-setup" class="anchor" href="#repository-setup" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Repository Setup</h2>

<p><strong>Creating your first repository:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Creating a repository in Cloud9 must be <strong><em>spelled exactly the same way</em></strong> when created in GitHub (the remote), or it will not properly push.<br>
</li>
<li>The repository can be set up with the command "git init"<br>

<ul>
<li>
<code>Important Side-note:</code>If you initialized git in the wrong directory, you'd have to remove git entirely from the directory by typing "rm -rf .git", this will completely remove git from the directory/repository.<br>
3.Next, using an SSH key can be very beneficial to efficiency, as information does not have to be typed every time you want to add to a file through the console line. To always have a repository saved in where it is "pushed" to using a git command, which is shown when a new repository is first created in GitHub, shown here; git remote add origin <a href="mailto:git@github.com">git@github.com</a>:(github username)/(repository name).git, (this allows you to push to your remote repository without having to type the whole URL) and git push -u origin master.<br>
</li>
<li>Now, since your Cloud9 repository has been linked with it's remote counter-part, it can now be fully used, and added to from the Cloud9 IDE, using a set of git commands, such as add, commit, and push.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<a id="workflow--commands" class="anchor" href="#workflow--commands" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Workflow &amp; Commands</h2>

<p><strong>Basics:</strong> When working with Git and GitHub, it's important to learn the workflow of saving, adding, committing, and pushing to your remote repository.<br>
1. Saving your file (Control S on PC, Command S on Mac) after editing before starting your workflow process is the first step.<br>
2. After saving, you must <strong>add</strong> your file to the "stage", meaning it is ready to be committed (command: git add (filename).(extension)<br>
3. Next, is an optional command called "<strong>git status</strong>", which is used to check what files have been edited since the last commit.<br>
4. Commiting your file is the next step, using the command "<strong>git commit -m"(short but specific message)"</strong> ". The reason for the message is for your own use, when looking back at past commits on GitHub so you have reference to what was changed in certain commits.<br>
5. Finally, the last command to use would be "<strong>git push</strong>", which will then "push" the code up to the remote repository.</p>
